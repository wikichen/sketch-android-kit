# Sketch Android Kit

This is a work-in-progress, comprehensive Android GUI template for [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).

**You can [download the latest release here](https://github.com/wikichen/sketch-android-kit/releases).**

Want to thank me? [Buy me a coffee][donate]. It'll keep the updates coming. :coffee:

![Document Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wikichen/sketch-android-kit/master/images/overview.png)

## Requirements

* [Sketch 3](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) - You will need to update to Sketch 3 if you haven't already, as the document relies heavily on symbols and is quite useless without them.

* [Roboto](http://developer.android.com/design/style/typography.html) - For the text styles to render properly, you will also need to install Roboto, the system font family introduced with Ice Cream Sandwich. The font is free under the Apache license.

## Structure

The document comprises two pages: the first an introductory artboard with a starter template and the second the main library of symbols and text styles you'll need to mock up your Android apps.

You'll notice similarities with the iOS UI Design template that ships with Sketch 3. It's intentional and is meant to be a complement to the included templates (because Android deserves some love, too).

## Support

The template currently supports and maintains assets for two display densities:
* XXHDPI (@3x) - linked (as symbols)
* XHDPI (@2x / Retina) - unlinked (in beta)

Artboards are based on the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 4, respectively. Currently the XXHDPI version is considered the official template, as I don't have an XHDPI device (e.g., Nexus 4) with which to recreate the GUI down to the pixel. If you'd like to see better support for XHDPI, consider [tipping me][donate] so I can invest in a reference device.

For those unfamiliar with the current spectrum of display densities, Jeff Broderick's [density converter](http://density.brdrck.me/) can help you get acquainted and make the proper calculations.

## Contributing

This is intended to be an open source project, and I will treat it as such. Do you see anything you would change or improve on, or wish that more UI elements or display densities are supported? Please feel free to submit an issue or a pull request to the repository.

You should first familiarize yourself with Android's design paradigm by reading through [Google's official Android design guide](https://developer.android.com/design/index.html).
